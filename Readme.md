# Experiments repo
In this repo I'll be adding simple experiments that I code to test something.
Nothing here is to be used in production and I do not provide support for any of the code here.

Again, the code here is just an example. Done _just for fun_.

## Repo structure
I plan to use the following structure:

```
/
└── python
    └── example_code0
    └── example_code1
    └── example_codeN
└── go
    └── example_code0
    └── example_codeN
```
