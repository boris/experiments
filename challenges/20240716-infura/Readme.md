1. Create an endpoint /balance that accepts an Ethereum address as a query
   parameter.
1. Use the Infura Ethereum API to fetch the latest block number and the balance
   of the provided address.
1. Return the block number and balance in the response.

## Solution
```
# using python 3.10.12
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

To test:
```
ÔÅî make check
curl -s "localhost:8000/balance?address=0xA33976bD76dE5Dd01Fa7c040927D40034AC28063" | jq
