Requirements:
1. List all running Docker containers.
1. For each running container, display its ID, name, status, and resource usage
   (CPU and memory).
1. Provide an option to stop a running container by its ID or name.

Steps to Complete:
1. Use Docker's CLI commands to interact with Docker containers.
1. Parse the output of the Docker commands to extract relevant information.
1. Display the information in a readable format.
1. Implement a function to stop a Docker container based on user input
   (container ID or name).

Guidelines:
- Use any programming language or scripting language you prefer.
- Handle potential errors gracefully, such as Docker not being installed or running, or invalid container IDs/names.
- Ensure the script is modular, with separate functions for listing containers and stopping a container.
